# A SoftBody3D Pinned Point addon for Godot 4.4+
This addon makes it easier to pin points on a `SoftBody3D` Node. The `SoftPin Node` uses Vertex Colors and separate the areas you want the `SoftBody3D` to simulate.
NOTE: The only reason the addon requires 4.4+ is because of the @export_tool_button that was added in 4.4 . If you replace that code for something else that achieves the same (for example, a boolean) - the rest of the addon will work just fine.

# Installation
1. Download the repository as a zip and extract it.
2. Copy the `addons` folder into the root folder of your project.
3. Go to Project > Project Settings > Plugins tab and enable SoftPin

4. You're ready to go! The `SoftPin Node` should be under Node

# How to use
>[!NOTE]
>First you'll need to vertex paint your model. That will require Blender or another 3D software of choice.

## Preparing your model
1. Select the mesh you want to vertex paint. 
2. Fill the entire model white or black with NO transparency. Values should look like image below:

3. Once the model is fully white or black, use any color and paint the area you want simulated. The non colored areas will be pinned.

4. Export your model to godot.

## Using the SoftPin Node
Add the `SoftPin Node` to the scene with the mesh you want to pin.

| Property              |     Description |
| --------------------- | -------------   |
|` Soft Body`  | Used to assign the SoftBody3D you want to pin |
|`Bone Attachment  ` | Used to attach the pinned points to `BoneAttachment3D` when Pin Type: is set to Skelelton3D |
|`Pin Type  `  | Method of pinning, If `MeshInstance3D` is selected you only need a SoftBody. If `Skeleton3D` is selected you'll need to include a BoneAttachment with the SoftBody  |
|` Start Pinning  `     | Used to start the pinning process once ready|
|`Pinning Status `| Debug menu that tells you the status of the pinning or errors                       |

## Pinning MeshInstance3D
When pinning a `MeshInstance3D ` convert the instance into a `SoftBody3D`, Assign the `SoftBody3D`, Set the `Pin Type:` to `MeshInstance3D`, and switch `Start Pinning` to On.

Once you're done you can delete the `SoftPin Node` from the scene or repeat the process with another `SoftBody3D`. Your days of wrestling with pins are finally over. 

## Pinning Skeleton3D
>[!WARNING]
>When using `PinType: Skeleton3D`, this is more ideal for things like hair, hanging cloth, and Accessories that only need one bone. Refer to [Current Gotchas](https://github.com/BryantCrisos/softPin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#current-gotchas) for more info.

Before starting to pin your initial setup should look something like this.

Select the `MeshInstance3D` under `Skeleton3D` you want to use. Convert the `MeshInstance3D` into a `SoftBody3D`, Assign the `SoftBody3D`, Assign the `BoneAttachment`, Set the `Pin Type:` to `Skeleton3D`, and switch `Start Pinning` to On.

Once finished go hit the play button to check out the SoftBody!

# Current Gotchas
> [!CAUTION]
> Below are limitations/issues caused by Godot, not the addon:

* Selecting the `SoftBody3D` Node After pinning causes editor lag. The denser the model the longer the lag. Keeping vert count under 4K per mesh helps. 
* On project start up, having a scene tab open with Nodes that have Spatial Attachments assigned in SoftBody3D prints this error: - _scene/3d/node_3d.cpp:345 - Condition "!is_inside_tree()" is true. Returning: Transform3D()_
* Unfortunately, When using `Jolt3D Physics` the quality of the SoftBody3D does not look as good as regular Godot Physics when simulating
* When you assign `Skeleton3D` In the SoftBody it breaks. Animations on the mesh do not deform properly.
